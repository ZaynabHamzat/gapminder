# gapminder
I downloaded the dataset from Click to Download->https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv
The dataset has 6 columns namely: country, year, pop, continent, lifeExp and gdpPercap.
I created a pivot table dataframe with year along x-axes, continent along y-axes and lifeExp filled within the cells.
I plotted a heatmap with seaborn for the pivot table created and another heatmap using Tableau.
